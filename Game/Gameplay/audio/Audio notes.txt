Hello Developer!

This just a quick notes on how the audio works on this freamwork:

So for some reason we can not really push on audio manager to control both SFX and the music. 
the way we sovle this is by dividing the manager into two! that is why we have a class which control the sounds and
one for the music.

this my best solution is I could get to. feel free to change things according to what fits your needs, and if you
found a better way to control both SFX and the music I would love to see! you can do that by requesting a pull request.

Thank you for your time :)
